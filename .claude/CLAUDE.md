# Development Guidelines

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass existing tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Process

### 1. Planning & Staging

Break complex work into 3-5 stages. Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]
**Goal**: [Specific deliverable]
**Success Criteria**: [Testable outcomes]
**Tests**: [Specific test cases - skip if no existing test framework]
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
```
- Update status as you progress
- Remove file when all stages are done

### 2. Implementation Flow

1. **Understand** - Study existing patterns in codebase
2. **Test** - Write test first (red) - *skip if no existing tests found*
3. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass (green)
4. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests passing (if applicable)
5. **Validate** - Run available quality checks (linters, formatters, build scripts, git hooks)
6. **Wait for PROCEED** - Only proceed to next stage when `PROCEED` signal given
   - Note: User may have made manual changes during the wait - assess and adapt plan if absolutely necessary

### 3. When Stuck (After 3 Attempts)

**CRITICAL**: Maximum 3 attempts per issue, then STOP.

1. **Document what failed**:
   - What you tried
   - Specific error messages
   - Why you think it failed

2. **Research alternatives**:
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations
   - Note different approaches used

3. **Question fundamentals**:
   - Is this the right abstraction level?
   - Can this be split into smaller problems?
   - Is there a simpler approach entirely?

4. **Try different angle**:
   - Different library/framework feature?
   - Different architectural pattern?
   - Remove abstraction instead of adding?

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Principles

- **Composition over inheritance** - Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons** - Enable testing and flexibility
- **Explicit over implicit** - Clear data flow and dependencies
- **Test-driven when tests exist** - Never disable existing tests, fix them instead

### Code Quality

- **Every commit must**:
  - Compile successfully
  - Pass all existing tests (if any)
  - Follow project formatting/linting
  - Run available quality checks (build scripts, pre-commit hooks)

- **Before committing**:
  - Run formatters/linters if available
  - Run any build/validation scripts
  - Self-review changes
  - Ensure commit message explains "why"

- **Testing approach**:
  - If tests exist: Include tests for new functionality
  - If no tests exist: Do not introduce testing framework unless explicitly requested

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive messages
- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions

## Git & Commit Guidelines

### Attribution & Metadata
- Do not mention AI authorship. Never state that the commit was generated by Claude Code or any other AI.
- Do not include co-author tags that reference Claude Code or similar tools.

### Commit Message Style
- Match the repository's existing commit message format. Review previous commits and follow the dominant style. For example:
  - If the repo uses **Conventional Commits** (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`), follow that format.
  - If the repo uses **imperative mood only** (e.g., `Add validation logic`, `Fix crash on load`), follow that instead.
- **Base the commit message on the actual staged changes**, not just the most recent user instruction. Always inspect the staged diff and summarize that accurately.

### Git Operations
- Do not run any git operations (`git add`, `git commit`, etc.). The developer handles all git operations.

### Stage Progression
- Only proceed to the next implementation stage when explicitly instructed with the exact signal: `PROCEED`
- If the `PROCEED` signal is not given:
  - Do not proceed to the next stage.
  - Assume there may be further instructions and respond accordingly.
  - User may make manual changes between stages - assess these changes when `PROCEED` is given.
- If the `PROCEED` signal is given:
  - Check for any manual changes made by the user since the last stage.
  - Adapt the implementation plan if absolutely necessary based on these changes.
  - Then proceed with the next stage in the implementation sequence.

## Decision Framework

When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this? (if tests already exist or if there are none, if it would be easy to add tests for it in the future)
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?

## Project Integration

### Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns (if any)

### Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework (if any)
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and passing (only if existing test framework found)
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Available quality checks pass (build scripts, git hooks)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No TODOs without issue numbers

### Test Guidelines (When Tests Exist)

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Use existing test utilities/helpers
- Tests should be deterministic

## Important Reminders

**NEVER**:
- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code
- Run any git operations - developer handles all git operations

**ALWAYS**:
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess
- Wait for explicit `PROCEED` signal before moving to next stage
- Check for manual user changes when `PROCEED` is given
- Remember that using `any` type is not recommended. Only use it as an absolute last resort. Otherwise, use the correct type based on the context
