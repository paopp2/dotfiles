## Commit Guidelines

When generating commits on behalf of the user, follow these strict rules to ensure consistency, clarity, and proper developer control.

### Attribution & Metadata
- **Do not mention AI authorship.**  
  Never state that the commit was generated by Claude Code or any other AI.
- **Do not include co-author tags** that reference Claude Code or similar tools.

### Commit Message Style
- **Match the repositoryâ€™s existing commit message format.**  
  Review previous commits and follow the dominant style:
  - If the repo uses **Conventional Commits** (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`), follow that format.
  - If the repo uses **imperative mood only** (e.g., `Add validation logic`, `Fix crash on load`), follow that instead.

### Staging Responsibility
- **Do not run `git add`.**  
  Leave file selection and staging entirely up to the developer. Do **not** guess or assume which files to include.

### Commit Execution Conditions
- **Only perform the commit when explicitly instructed.**  
- Wait for the exact signal: "COMMIT"
- Without this signal, **do not commit.**
- If the signal is received, perform the commit.
- **After committing, immediately continue implementing the next step** in the sequence of instructions, if any are provided.
