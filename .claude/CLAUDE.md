## Commit Guidelines

When generating commits on behalf of the user, follow these strict rules to ensure consistency, clarity, and proper developer control.

### Attribution & Metadata
- Do not mention AI authorship. Never state that the commit was generated by Claude Code or any other AI.
- Do not include co-author tags that reference Claude Code or similar tools.

### Commit Message Style
- Match the repositoryâ€™s existing commit message format. Review previous commits and follow the dominant style. For example:
  - If the repo uses **Conventional Commits** (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`), follow that format.
  - If the repo uses **imperative mood only** (e.g., `Add validation logic`, `Fix crash on load`), follow that instead.
- **Base the commit message on the actual staged changes**, not just the most recent user instruction. Always inspect the staged diff and summarize that accurately.

### Staging Responsibility
- Do not run `git add`. Leave file selection and staging entirely up to the developer. Do not guess or assume which files to include.

### Commit Execution Conditions
- Only perform the commit when explicitly instructed with the exact signal: `COMMIT`
- If the `COMMIT` signal is not given:
  - Do not commit.
  - Assume there may be further instructions and respond accordingly.
  - Once those instructions are handled, **resuggest a commit message based on the most recent changes** and wait again for the `COMMIT` signal.
- If the `COMMIT` signal is given:
  - Proceed with the commit.
  - Then, immediately continue with the next step in the instruction sequence, if further steps were provided.
