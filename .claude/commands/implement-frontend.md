# Implement Frontend

You are tasked with implementing frontend features that are beautiful, elegant, and consistent with the existing design while following KISS and SOLID principles.

## Input Handling

The command accepts input in multiple ways:
1. **File path**: {{ARGS}} - Read implementation details from a file
2. **Image path**: {{ARGS}} - Read and analyze a design mockup or wireframe image
3. **Text description**: {{ARGS}} - Use the provided text as feature requirements
4. **Combination**: {{ARGS}} - Mix of file paths, image paths, and text descriptions

The command will intelligently parse the input and handle each type appropriately.

## Core Philosophy

- **Simple, elegant, minimal solutions** - Beautiful but not complex
- **Consistent with existing design** - Study and match current UI patterns
- **Mock data by default** - Use mock data and API calls unless user explicitly requests existing functions
- **Modern and pretty** - Clean, beautiful, but maintainable design
- **KISS and SOLID principles** - Keep it simple, follow solid architecture
- **Easy backend integration** - Clear TODO markers for backend connections

## Implementation Flow

### 1. Analysis Phase

**Input Processing:**
- If file path provided: Read and parse the implementation file
- If image path provided: Analyze the design mockup or wireframe to understand UI requirements
- If text provided: Use as feature requirements directly
- If combination provided: Process each input type and synthesize requirements
- **Check for existing function usage**: If user explicitly mentions using existing backend functions, identify and analyze them
- Validate input and ensure requirements are clear

**Research Phase:**
- **UI/UX Research**: Search for best practices and modern patterns for the feature type
  - Look up current design trends for similar features
  - Research accessibility considerations
  - Find elegant, minimal design examples
- **Codebase Analysis**: Study existing patterns and conventions
  - Identify current UI framework/library (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
  - Find existing components and design patterns
  - Analyze current styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.)
  - Study color schemes, typography, spacing patterns
  - Identify existing loading and error state patterns
  - **Search for existing backend functions** if user requested their usage
  - **Infer component structure** from project setup and existing patterns

### 2. Design Planning

**Consistency Analysis:**
- Map out existing design system elements
- Identify reusable components and utilities
- Determine styling approach to match current patterns
- Plan component structure following existing conventions

**Feature Architecture:**
- Design component hierarchy following SOLID principles
- Plan state management approach (local state, context, store)
- **Choose data approach**:
  - **Default**: Design mock data structure that mirrors expected backend API
  - **If existing functions specified**: Plan integration with identified backend functions
- Plan loading and error state implementations

### 3. Implementation Phase

**Component Creation:**
- Follow existing component patterns and naming conventions
- Implement clean, readable component structure
- Use existing styling patterns and design tokens
- Ensure responsive design following current breakpoint patterns

**Data Integration:**
- **Default approach (mock data)**:
  - Create realistic mock data that represents actual backend responses
  - Add artificial delays (500-1500ms) for loading states
  - Implement error simulation for robust error handling
  - Add clear TODO comments for backend integration points:
    ```javascript
    // TODO: Should fetch user profile data from API
    // TODO: Should update user data here
    // TODO: Should delete item via API call
    ```
- **When existing functions specified**:
  - Integrate with identified backend functions
  - Add proper error handling for real API calls
  - Include TODO comments for any missing backend functionality

**State Management:**
- Implement loading states with elegant loading indicators
- Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Follow existing error handling patterns in the codebase
- Ensure state updates are clean and predictable

### 4. Git Integration & Commits

**Atomic Commit Strategy:**
- Create small, focused commits for each logical change
- Each commit should be runnable and not break functionality
- Use `git add` and `git commit` for each atomic change
- Follow repository's existing commit message format

**Commit Flow:**
1. **Initial setup**: Add basic component structure
2. **Styling**: Add styles matching existing design
3. **Mock data**: Implement mock data and state management
4. **Loading states**: Add loading indicators and transitions
5. **Error handling**: Implement error states and recovery
6. **Responsive design**: Ensure mobile/tablet compatibility
7. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
8. **Polish**: Final refinements and code cleanup

### 5. Quality Assurance

**Code Quality:**
- Run available linters and formatters
- Ensure TypeScript compliance (if applicable)
- Verify accessibility standards
- Test responsive behavior across breakpoints

**Integration Testing:**
- Verify component integrates cleanly with existing layout
- Test loading and error states
- Ensure consistent styling with existing components
- Validate that TODOs are clear for backend integration

## Data Integration Guidelines

### Mock Data Approach (Default)

**Structure:**
```javascript
// Example mock service structure
const mockApiCall = async () => {
  // TODO: Should replace with actual API call to /api/users

  // Simulate network delay
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 800));

  // Simulate occasional errors (10% chance)
  if (Math.random() < 0.1) {
    throw new Error('Network error - please try again');
  }

  return mockData;
};
```

### Existing Functions Approach (When Specified)

**When user explicitly requests using existing backend functions:**
- Search codebase for relevant API functions, services, or data fetchers
- Analyze function signatures and return types
- Integrate directly with existing functions
- Add error handling appropriate to the existing patterns
- Document any missing functionality with specific TODOs

**Data Realism:**
- Use realistic data that matches expected backend structure
- Include edge cases (empty states, long text, missing fields)
- Provide variety in data for thorough testing
- Include proper data types and validation

## Styling Guidelines

**Consistency Requirements:**
- Use existing color palette and design tokens
- Follow current spacing and typography scale
- Match existing component sizing and proportions
- Use consistent animation and transition patterns

**Modern Design Principles:**
- Clean, minimal layouts with appropriate whitespace
- Subtle shadows and borders following existing patterns
- Consistent iconography and visual hierarchy
- Smooth interactions and micro-animations (if existing)

## Component Structure

**Infer from Project:**
- Study existing component organization patterns
- Follow current file naming conventions
- Use existing directory structure
- Match current import/export patterns
- Adapt to project's chosen architecture (feature-based, atomic design, etc.)

## Error Handling Standards

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton loaders or spinner following existing patterns
- Progressive loading for better perceived performance
- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable

**Error States:**
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Fallback UI when features are unavailable
- Consistent error styling with existing patterns

## Git Commit Examples

**Atomic Commit Messages:**
```
feat: add user profile component structure
style: implement profile styling with existing design tokens
feat: add mock user data with loading simulation
feat: implement loading states for profile component
feat: add error handling and retry mechanism
style: ensure responsive design for profile component
feat: add accessibility attributes to profile component
refactor: extract reusable profile card component
```

## Critical Rules

- **Study before implementing**: Always analyze existing patterns first
- **Consistency over novelty**: Match existing design over new patterns
- **Mock data by default**: Use mock data unless user explicitly requests existing functions
- **When existing functions requested**: Search, analyze, and integrate with identified backend functions
- **Clear integration points**: TODOs must be specific and actionable
- **Responsive by default**: All components must work across breakpoints
- **Accessibility compliance**: Follow existing a11y patterns
- **Performance conscious**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders and heavy operations
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should be small, focused, and runnable
- **Infer structure**: Don't assume - study the project's actual patterns

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Beautiful and elegant** - Visually appealing and modern design
- [ ] **Consistent design** - Matches existing UI patterns perfectly
- [ ] **Appropriate data approach** - Mock data by default, existing functions when requested
- [ ] **Proper loading states** - Elegant loading indicators with delays
- [ ] **Robust error handling** - Comprehensive error states and recovery
- [ ] **Clean architecture** - Follows SOLID and KISS principles
- [ ] **Clear integration points** - Specific TODOs for backend (mock approach) or missing functionality (existing functions approach)
